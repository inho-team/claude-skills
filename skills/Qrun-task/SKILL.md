# Task Execution Skill

## Role
Execute tasks and complete verification based on spec documents from `/Qgenerate-spec`.

> **MANDATORY:** All user confirmations MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Do NOT output options as plain text — always call the tool.

## Workflow
```
/Qgenerate-spec → /Qrun-task → Read → Summarize → Approve → Execute → Verify → ✅ Done
```

## Directory Structure
```
.qe/tasks/{pending,in-progress,completed,on-hold}/TASK_REQUEST_*.md
.qe/checklists/{pending,in-progress,completed,on-hold}/VERIFY_CHECKLIST_*.md
.qe/tasks/remediation/REMEDIATION_REQUEST_*.md
```

## Delegation Rule
When checklist has **5+ items**, delegate to `Etask-executor` agent. Main agent tracks progress, state transitions, and verification. After delegation, update timestamps: `- [x] item ✅ (HH:MM)`.

**Model selection when spawning Etask-executor:**

Read the TASK_REQUEST checklist for `<!-- complexity: ... -->` tags, then pick the model:

| Condition | Model |
|-----------|-------|
| Any item tagged `complexity: high` | `sonnet` |
| All items tagged `complexity: low` | `haiku` |
| No tags, ≤ 3 items, single-file scope | `haiku` |
| No tags, 4–7 items | `sonnet` |
| No tags, 8+ items OR cross-cutting architecture | `sonnet` |

Pass the selected model as the `model` parameter when spawning `Etask-executor`.

## Step 1: Document Discovery

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` for context
2. Glob `.qe/tasks/{pending,in-progress,on-hold}/*.md` for TASK_REQUEST files
3. Backward compat: check project root if `.qe/tasks/` missing
4. Multiple tasks → ask which to run. UUID argument → select directly
5. Multiple UUIDs (space-separated) → parallel execution (see **Multiple UUID Execution** section below)

## Step 2: Summary and Approval

Read TASK_REQUEST + VERIFY_CHECKLIST, show summary:

| `type:` | Banner |
|---------|--------|
| `code` | `⚠️ TYPE: CODE — will CREATE or MODIFY source code` |
| `docs` | `📄 TYPE: DOCS — will CREATE or MODIFY documentation` |
| `analysis` | `🔍 TYPE: ANALYSIS — read-only analysis` |
| `other` | `🔧 TYPE: OTHER` |
| unset | `❓ TYPE: UNSET — review carefully` |

```
[Banner]
## Task Summary: [Name]
**What:** [1-2 sentences]  **How:** [core method]
**Steps** (N items): [list]  **Validation** (M items): [list]
```

**Chained execution skip:** If TASK_REQUEST contains `<!-- chained-from: Qgenerate-spec -->`, skip the approval prompt (user already approved in Qgenerate-spec). Remove the comment after reading.

Otherwise, use `AskUserQuestion` for approval. On approve → move files to `in-progress/`, set CLAUDE.md to 🔶.

## Step 3: Execute

Execute checklist items in order. Report: `✅ [1/N] desc - done`. Record `- [x] item ✅ (HH:MM)`.

**Code task**: After Step 3, ask whether to run `/Qcode-run-task` quality loop.

**Intermediate verification**: Every 3 items (or per `<!-- verify-interval: N -->`), check relevant VERIFY_CHECKLIST items. Fix failures before continuing.

## Step 4: Final Verification

Verify **each** VERIFY_CHECKLIST item with a concrete action — "build passed" alone is NOT sufficient.

| Item type | Verification action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| File exists | `Glob` for the path |
| Code behavior | `Grep` for expected pattern or run test |
| Build/compile | `tsc --noEmit` or project build command |
| No regression | Run existing test suite |
| Security | Invoke `Esecurity-officer` (see below) |
| Visual/UI | Screenshot via chrome tools if available |

Report per item: `✅ PASS` or `❌ FAIL (reason)`. All pass → Step 5. Failures → fix and re-verify (max 2 retries, then escalate).

### Security Verification (Mandatory for code + security keywords)

When `type: code` AND TASK_REQUEST contains any of: auth, crypto, payment, JWT, password, secret, token, credential, bcrypt:
1. Invoke `Esecurity-officer` agent with `git diff HEAD` context
2. Integrate findings into VERIFY_CHECKLIST security items
3. FAIL grade from Esecurity-officer blocks Step 5 until resolved

This is **mandatory**, not a recommendation.

## Step 4.5: Supervision Gate

After verification, run the Supervision Gate to get expert-level quality assessment.

**skip-supervision conditions** (skip if ALL true):
- Task is `type: docs` or `type: analysis` with fewer than 5 items
- Single-item tasks
- MD-only changes

**never skip-supervision for `type: code` tasks** — code always goes through the gate.

Track `supervision_iteration` counter in `.qe/state/session-stats.json` to persist across session compactions. Increment on each supervision round.

1. Invoke `Esupervision-orchestrator` with task context and verification results
2. If grade is PASS → proceed to Step 5
3. If grade is PARTIAL → apply suggested improvements, re-verify
4. If grade is FAIL → save REMEDIATION_REQUEST, re-execute failed items via Etask-executor

**Agent Trigger Check:** After supervision, check `.qe/agent-triggers/` for trigger files written by agents during execution:
1. Glob `.qe/agent-triggers/*.trigger.md`
2. For each trigger: spawn the target agent with the provided context (in parallel if multiple)
3. Delete processed trigger files
4. If triggered agents produce new findings, append to verification results

Skip agent triggers if no trigger files exist.

## Step 5: Completion

1. Mark all items `[x]` in TASK_REQUEST and VERIFY_CHECKLIST
2. Move files to `completed/`
3. Update CLAUDE.md to ✅
4. `type: code` → call `Ecode-doc-writer`; `type: docs` → call `Edoc-generator`
5. Auto-run `/Qarchive` in background
6. Clean up `.qe/agent-results/` (delete result files older than current task)

Report: UUID, items completed, verification passed, changed files.

### Next Task Prompt

After completion, check for remaining tasks:
1. Read CLAUDE.md task table — find tasks with status `진행 전` or `🔲`
2. Also check `.qe/tasks/pending/` for queued TASK_REQUEST files
3. If next tasks exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to prompt:
   - List upcoming tasks (UUID + name)
   - Ask: "다음 작업을 실행하려면 `/Qrun-task {UUID}`를 실행해주세요."
4. If no remaining tasks, skip this step

## Special Situations

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No documents | Suggest `/Qgenerate-spec` |
| Task interrupted | Save progress with timestamps, leave in `in-progress/` |
| On hold | Move to `on-hold/`, set ⏸️ |
| Resume | Move to `in-progress/`, continue from last unchecked item |
| Etask-executor crash | Offer Resume/Retry/Abort |
| No CLAUDE.md | Proceed without context, notify user |

## Multiple UUID Execution

**Parallel by default.** When multiple UUIDs are passed (space-separated), spawn one `Etask-executor` Agent per UUID concurrently.

### Execution Flow
```
/Qrun-task {UUID1} {UUID2} {UUID3}
  │
  ├─ Read all TASK_REQUESTs → check for inter-dependencies
  │
  ├─ No dependencies found (default):
  │    ├─ Agent spawn: Etask-executor(UUID1)  ─┐
  │    ├─ Agent spawn: Etask-executor(UUID2)  ─┼─ parallel
  │    └─ Agent spawn: Etask-executor(UUID3)  ─┘
  │         Each runs Steps 2-5 independently
  │
  └─ Dependencies found (fallback):
       └─ Sequential: UUID1 → UUID2 → UUID3
          (only when task B's input is task A's output)
```

### Parallel Execution Rules
1. **Spawn all agents in a single tool-call block** — do not await one before spawning the next
2. **File ownership**: no two agents may write the same file. If overlap detected, serialize those tasks
3. **Shared files** (i18n, config, barrel exports, package manifests): Qrun-task edits these after all agents complete, merging their requirements
4. **Independent state**: each agent moves its own TASK_REQUEST/VERIFY_CHECKLIST through `pending → in-progress → completed`
5. **On failure**: skip failed task, continue others, report all results at end

### Dependency Detection
Before spawning, scan each TASK_REQUEST for:
- Explicit `depends: {UUID}` in notes
- Output path of task A appearing as input reference in task B's checklist

If dependencies exist, topologically sort and execute in waves (parallel within each wave, sequential across waves).

## Autonomous Mode (Ultra)

When `.qe/state/ultra{work,qa}-state.json` is active:
- Skip Step 2 approval
- Auto-proceed on judgments
- `--ultraqa`: auto-run code quality loop
- Multiple UUIDs: parallel Etask-executor agents

## Coding Expert References

Reference `skills/coding-experts/` for language/framework best practices. Catalog: `skills/coding-experts/CATALOG.md`.

## Role Constraints
- Only executes existing spec documents
- Use `/Qgenerate-spec` to create specs
- Do not modify spec content (except checking off items)
